# CS113
Homework assignments I completed in MiraCosta's CS-113 (Basic Data Structures and Algorithms).  The course uses Agile methodologies to better develop software with the aid of efficient algorithms and well constructed data structures. Topics included searching, sorting, hashing, algorithm analysis, object-oriented design, collections, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, dictionaries, and graphs.
